:code:`BoboCEP` is a
`Complex Event Processing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_event_processing>`_
(CEP) engine designed for

in
`Internet of Things <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things>`_
(IoT) systems to facilitate inferential reasoning and decision-making on streaming data.
It provides
`fault tolerance <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_tolerance>`_
(FT) via the
`active replication <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_(computing)>`_
of partially-completed complex events across multiple instances of the software.
