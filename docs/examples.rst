Simple
======

This example demonstrates setting up a simple, non-distributed :code:`BoboCEP`
instance with a single pattern:
:code:`1`, followed by :code:`2`, followed by :code:`3`.
The engine runs on a separate thread, and a :code:`for` loop adds numbers
:code:`0` to :code:`4` to the data stream in 1-second intervals.
When the pattern is fulfilled, an instance of the custom action
:code:`BoboActionPrint` prints :code:`"Hello 123!"`.

Advanced
========

This example shows you how to set up :code:`BoboCEP` without
relying on the :code:`BoboSetup` classes.

Distributed
===========

The :code:`BoboSetupSimpleDistributed` class uses TCP for decentralised
message-passing, and requires AES encryption to encrypt all traffic
between :code:`BoboCEP` instances.

- The AES key that you choose must be 16, 24, or 32 bytes long
  for AES-128, AES-192, or AES-256 encryption, respectively.

Distributed works by defining a list of :code:`BoboDevice` representing
all :code:`BoboCEP` instances (including yourself) that will synchronise
together, and providing each device with a unique URN and an ID key
to identify the events generated by a device and identify exchanged messages
from that device, respectively.


.. warning::
    The ID keys that you use for devices, and the AES key, are expected
    to be kept secret and **not** hard-coded into your software.
    The example below is for demonstration purposes only.


Similar to the :ref:`examples:Simple` example above, there is a single pattern
that expects :code:`a`, followed by :code:`b`, followed by :code:`c`, with
an additional haltcondition :code:`h` that will halt any partially-completed
run for this pattern.

Then, run the following code as :code:`dist_2.py`. This will represent
device :code:`urn:bobocep:device:2`. This code also has an additional
:code:`for` loop that will generate data for :code:`device:2`
to consume. If you watch the outlog logs, you should see state synchronisation

Flask
=====

Similar to the :ref:`examples:Simple` example above, there is a single pattern
that expects :code:`1`, followed by :code:`2`, followed by :code:`3`.
However, these values must, instead, be provided via GET requests using
a `Flask <https://flask.palletsprojects.com/>`_ server.

This can be accomplished with three separate calls, as follows:

- :code:`http://127.0.0.1:8080/data/int/1`
- :code:`http://127.0.0.1:8080/data/int/2`
- :code:`http://127.0.0.1:8080/data/int/3`

Each time the phenomenon's pattern is fulfilled, it increments its internal
counter and prints a message to stdout, displaying its action name, the current
counter value, and the ID of the complex event that was generated. For example:
:code:`action_counter 1: 1681645446_0`.


.. warning::
    If you want to use the :code:`BoboActionHandlerMultiprocessing`
    action handler, then using :code:`RLock` may cause action execution
    to not work as intended. Therefore, it is recommended that
    you use the :code:`Blocking` and :code:`Multithreading` handlers
    for synchronised action execution.
