:code:`bobocep` is a `complex event processing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_event_processing>`_ (CEP) engine
designed for `edge computing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_computing>`_ in
`Internet of Things <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things>`_ (IoT) systems
to provide inferential reasoning and decision making using stream data.
It provides `fault tolerance <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_tolerance>`_ (FT) via the
`active replication <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_(computing)>`_ of
partially-completed complex events across multiple instances of the software using a
`message broker <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_broker>`_.

This is **experimental** software that is currently being used for research purposes.
All aspects of the software are subject to change.
