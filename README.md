# BoboCEP

`BoboCEP` is a [complex event processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_event_processing) (CEP) engine
designed for [edge computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_computing) in
[Internet of Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) (IoT) systems
to provide inferential reasoning and decision making using stream data.
It provides [fault tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_tolerance) (FT) via the
[active replication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_(computing)) of
partially completed complex events across other instances of `BoboCEP` software.
