"""
End-to-end tests that simulate data input from external sources into the
BoboCEP system and check for correct responses in return. For example, complex
events are generated and actions are executed as expected.

These tests are to be executed via the Postman API testing software.
Each test provides a Postman script that needs to be imported into Postman and
executed using the "Run collection" option.
