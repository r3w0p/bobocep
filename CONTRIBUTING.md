Always write clear log messages with your commits.

### Testing

When testing your code, use the same packages that are provided in 
[requirements.txt](https://github.com/r3w0p/bobocep/blob/master/requirements.txt), namely: pytest, coverage.

### Coding Conventions

Use the [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) style guide for Python code.
The [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/tutorial-code-quality-assistance-tips-and-tricks.html) 
IDE can help with this.

Try to remain consistent with existing code e.g. same indentation.
